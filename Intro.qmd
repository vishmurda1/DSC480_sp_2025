## Ibis program - ROI

A comparison study

-   Patients with chronic conditions

-   *Ibis* tablet device vs control group

-   "Natural experiment"

-   Track utilization

    -   inpatient hospital admissions
    -   probability of one or more admissions
    -   time to event
    -   ER visits

## The study

<div>

*The effect of Senscio Systems’ Chronic Disease Management Program, Ibis Health on all-cause hospital admissions in members of UniCare’s Medicare Supplemental insurance plans: A cluster-randomized trial*

</div>

###

## The study

-   patients enrolled during 2024

-   rolled out in different geographical regions in Massachusetts,

    -   a new region each month,

    -   half assigned the Ibis device, half as control group

    -   6 months later the control group also assigned the Ibis device

#### How does the utilization compare between the two groups?

## Your job

-   **Exploratory data analysis and data visualization**

-   **Statistical modeling of health outcomes.**

-   **Visualization**

-   **Data engineeering**

## Tools

-   R, python, SQL

-   RStudio, Positron, VScode

-   Git, Github

## Tools

#### `tidyverse`

<https://www.tidyverse.org/>

#### Quarto

#### Causal ML

## Meetings, delivarables, evaluation

-   Each team will have weekly meetings

-   Periodic check-in with with organizational representatives.

-   Students will be expected to maintain a branch of the project repository on github, and to make regular contributions in the form of push and pull requests with code updates.

-   Show regular progress on projects at meetings

-   Contribute positively to discussions and collaboration

-   Students will keep a log of their daily activity.

-   Students will submit monthly written summary progress reports

-   Students will submit a final written report, presentation

-   Completed work products in the form of usable models, plaftorms, analysis, dashboards, etc.

## CITI training

You ***must*** complete this to continue in the course!

## The data

## Before we get started...

-   Complete CITI training
-   Computational setup


## Modeling

-   Poisson regression for count data
-   Zero-inflated poisson for, well, zero inflated data.
-   logistic regression for admissions yes/no
-   ML models?
-   Causal inference methods.

## Preliminary analysis

-   Compare Unicare vs MIIA (two different groups in the data)
-   Compare the Unicare pre vs post Ibis

## Initial tasks

-   Confirm consistency of summary data - are we getting what they are?
-   Summary statistics on populations
