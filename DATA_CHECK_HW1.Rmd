# DSC 480: Initial Tasks# 1. Computational Setup- Set up IDEs, GitHub repos, forked, and cloned the repository to the local machine.

## 2. Summary Statistics and Exploratory Analysis, calculate summary statistics for the 'events' and 'report' tables. 

this is going to help us understand the distribution of data

-   we gotta import the data from 'read_clean.R'

```{r}
setwd("/Users/vishmurda/DSC480_GitHub_Repository")
getwd

```

```{r}
events <- read_csv("/Users/vishmurda/DSC480_GitHub_Repository/events_toy.csv")
report <- read_csv("/Users/vishmurda/DSC480_GitHub_Repository/report_toy.csv")
```

-   now we gotta compute the summary statistics for both of the datasets

    ```{r}
    head(summary(events))
    head(summary(report))
    ```

    -   cleaning the data( took this from clean data)

```{r}
events_full <- events %>% # Converting Timestamps to Date Format
  mutate_at(vars(contains("timestamp")), ~as.POSIXct(.x, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(contains("timestamp")), ~as_date(.x)) %>% # Renaming Columns
  rename_with(~str_replace(., "timestamp", "date"), contains("timestamp")) %>%
  mutate(across(event_type, ~ str_replace(.x, " ", "_"))) |> # Cleaning event_type Strings
  mutate(across(event_type, ~as.factor(.x))) #Converting event_type to Factor


report_full <- report %>%
  mutate_at(vars(contains("timestamp")), ~as.POSIXct(.x, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) %>% # Converting Timestamps to Date Format
  mutate_at(vars(contains("timestamp")), ~as_date(.x)) %>% #Renaming Columns
  rename_with(~str_replace(., "timestamp", "date"), contains("timestamp")) %>%
    mutate(across(event_type, ~ str_replace(.x, " ", "_"))) |> #Cleaning event_type Strings
  mutate(across(event_type, ~as.factor(.x))) #Converting event_type to Factor

sum(is.na(events_full$event_start_date)) # check if any rows have NA values due to invalid timestamp formats
```

print out the summary of the cleaned data

```{r}
summary(events_full)
```

now for the other file

```{r}
summary(report_full)
```

```{r}
summary(events_full$event_start_date) 
summary(report_full$event_start_date)
```

some visualizations

now we got to do the same thing but for coverage on preibis vs post ibis

## 4. Descriptive Statistics for Combined Groups
### Goals
#Perform descriptive statistics for the `Unicare-study` group using Ibis and compare it to the combined dataset when Ibis is not used (MIIA).

### Key Metrics
#1. Total days under observation.
#2. Total inpatient days.
#3. Proportion of patients with at least one inpatient admission.
#4. Counts of inpatient admissions.

#---

## 5. Data Cleaning Function
### Goal
#Create a function that reads and cleans data, using the logic in `read_clean.R`.

#```r
#read_clean_data <- function(file) {
  # Add code here based on `read_clean.R`
#}
```
